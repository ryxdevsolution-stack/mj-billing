## Migration is Idempotent

The migration script is **safe to re-run**. It will:
- Skip creating tables if they already exist
- Skip adding columns if they already exist
- Update customer data with latest information on conflict
- Not duplicate any data

---

## Future Enhancements

You can now enhance the customer management with:
- Customer editing and updating
- Customer notes and tags
- Customer segmentation
- Customer lifetime value calculation
- Customer purchase behavior analytics
- Email/SMS marketing to customers
- Customer loyalty programs
